# Coding for Everyone C and C++
This is a Specialization programme from UCSC on Coursera

Personal ideas:

At first, I just planned to use these courses to review knowledges of C/C++. 

But later, I found the lectures are too concise that it may not help me to understand the points that I don't.

So I just started to used the assignments for practicing.

The ones in first course is simple, but from the second one, it gets much harder.

So I decided to upload assignments that I think worth to review here. Hope it may give me and people needed some inspiration later on.

For the courses, I recommend it to people with fundamental coding skills as it is too fast and not comprehensive enough for the newbies.

For the assignments, some of the instructions are not clear from my perspective. And most of them are peer-review so there's no "correct answers".

But from the positive side, it pushes me to research more by myself. It takes a lot of time, but it worth it. 

Because I think it is the most important skill for a person who would like to take coding as his/her career.
